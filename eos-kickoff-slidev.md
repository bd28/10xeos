# üöÄ Accelerated Implementation

**Typical EOS implementations take 6-12 months with multiple sessions and external consultants.**

**We're condensing this into a single 4-hour session and immediate execution.**

<div class="mt-8">

### What this means for the team:
- **We're moving 10x faster** than standard EOS rollouts
- **You may need to do some homework** outside this meeting to fully digest concepts
- **We'll learn together as we go** - no one needs to be an EOS expert
- **This is a team effort** - we're all in this together

</div>

**Our approach: Build the foundation today, perfect it through weekly practice.**

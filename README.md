# EOS Implementation at 10X ERP

This repository contains the complete documentation and implementation plan for implementing the **Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS)** at 10X ERP.

## What is EOS?

The **Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS)** is a comprehensive business management system designed specifically for entrepreneurial companies. It provides a framework for:

- **Vision & Alignment**: Getting everyone on the same page about where we're going
- **Accountability & Execution**: Ensuring we follow through on our commitments  
- **Focus & Discipline**: Eliminating distractions and staying on track
- **Growth & Scaling**: Building systems that support sustainable expansion

## Implementation Approach

**ðŸš€ ACCELERATED IMPLEMENTATION**  
While typical EOS implementations take 6-12 months with external consultants, we're taking an accelerated approach:
- **Single 4-hour kickoff session** to establish foundation
- **Immediate implementation** of weekly L10 meetings
- **Learn and refine** through weekly practice
- **Iterative improvement** as we discover what works for our team

**Timeline**: September 2025 kickoff â†’ Full implementation by end of 2025

## The Six Key Components of EOS

1. **Vision/Traction Organizer (V/TO)** - Company direction and priorities
2. **People** - Right people in right seats
3. **Data** - Scorecard with weekly numbers
4. **Issues** - IDS process for problem-solving
5. **Process** - Core business processes documented
6. **Traction** - 90-day Rocks and weekly execution

## Leadership Team Roles

- **Visionary (CEO)**: Sets vision and priorities, key relationships, big ideas
- **Integrator (COO, Michael)**: Runs day-to-day, drives execution, owns meeting pulse
- **Sales (Mike)**: Owns revenue, pipeline, forecasting, sales process
- **Product & Engineering (CTO, Liviu)**: Roadmap, engineering execution, quality
- **Customer Success/Delivery (Jim)**: Onboarding, training, launches, customer service

## Meeting Cadence

- **Weekly**: Leadership L10 (60 minutes)
- **Quarterly**: 4-hour planning and Rock-setting
- **Annual**: Full-day planning (target early Jan 2026)
- **Departmental L10s**: Start after leadership L10 is stable

## Tools & Technology

- **Google Sheets** for all EOS tools and templates
- **Google Meet** for remote-first meetings
- **Standard EOS templates** with minimal customization

## Success Criteria

**EOS is "installed" when we have:**
- Weekly Leadership L10 running to spec for 8+ consecutive weeks
- Finalized V/TO and leadership Accountability Chart
- Scorecard with 12 metrics, owners, thresholds, and weekly trend data
- Q4 Rocks completed/graded; Q1 2026 Rocks set
- At least Sales and Engineering running consistent L10s

## Why EOS Now?

As we scale 10X ERP, we're experiencing the natural challenges of growth:
- **Complexity increasing** with more customers, products, and team members
- **Decisions becoming more complex** as we grow beyond startup mode
- **Communication gaps** emerging between different parts of the business
- **Execution challenges** as we try to do more with our current structure

EOS will give us the clarity, focus, alignment, and execution systems we need to scale efficiently.

## EOS at 10X ERP — self-implementation plan (private brainstorm)

This is a concise working draft for how we’ll self-implement EOS at 10X ERP. It’s not meant for external circulation. We’ll start around 2025-09-01 and aim to have EOS fully installed with the leadership team by end of 2025.

### Intent and guiding principles
- **Why now**: Create focus, alignment, and accountability to scale efficiently with a small team.
- **Keep it simple**: Use standard EOS tools with minimal customization.
- **Discipline over tools**: Cadence and follow-through matter more than software.
- **Measured outcomes**: Run the company on a small Scorecard and 90-day Rocks.

### Roles and accountability (leadership)
- **Visionary (CEO)**: Sets vision and priorities, key relationships, big ideas, approves tie‑breaks.
- **Integrator (COO, Michael)**: Runs day-to-day, drives execution, owns meeting pulse, resolves cross-functional issues.
- **Sales (Mike)**: Owns revenue, pipeline, forecasting, sales process.
- **Product & Engineering (CTO, Liviu)**: Roadmap, engineering execution, quality, reliability.
- **Customer Success/Delivery (Jim)**: New-customer onboarding, training, data conversion, launches, and customer service.

Note: No separate Finance role at this stage; basic admin/finance handled within the Integrator’s role as needed.

Artifacts: `Accountability Chart` (leadership now; departmental layers added as we scale), `V/TO`, `Scorecard`, `Rocks`, `Issues List`, `People Analyzer`, `Core Processes`.

### Meeting cadence (pulse)
Remote-first: all meetings are on Google Meet. Start/stop on time. Michael (Integrator) leads and shares screen with Google Sheet for Scorecard, Rocks, Issues, and To-Dos. Team members record their own to-dos.
- **Leadership L10**: Weekly, 60 minutes; facilitator: Integrator; timebox strictly.
- **Departmental L10s**: Start with Sales, Product/Engineering, and Customer Success/Delivery once leadership L10 is stable.
- **Quarterly**: 4-hour planning and Rock-setting each quarter; EOS-style session with IDS.
- **Annual**: Full-day annual planning (target early Jan after first EOS quarter completes).

Baseline agendas follow EOS Level 10 and Quarterly templates (Scorecard, Rock review, customer/employee headlines, to‑dos, IDS, conclude).

### Scorecard (weekly KPIs)
- **Sales**: # in Stages (Lead, Discovery, Demo, Proposal), Pipeline Weighted Value, New ARR, Current ARR, Avg Deal Age, Nurture Pipeline Value
- **Engineering**: Velocity % (hours completed ÷ working hours), Patches (count; minimize), Open Issues (count; minimize), AI Boost (hours saved by AI vs manual)
- **Customer**: Pre‑launch counts by stage (signed, data migration, access, launch < 1 month); Support: new conversations, pending, resolved, first meaningful reply time

Keep to exactly 12 weekly numbers with owners and thresholds; red numbers trigger IDS, not blame.

Financial metrics are reviewed in Quarterly/Annual sessions (not in weekly L10).

### Rocks (example Q4 2025 themes)
- Finalize and communicate the `V/TO` (company-level Rock)
- Stand up the weekly `Scorecard` with owners and thresholds
- Sales: tighten ICP, messaging, and repeatable sales process/playbook; achieve X% improvement in pipeline stage progression
- Product/Eng: establish a release train and incident response with postmortems; reduce open issues by X% and improve AI Boost hours by X%
- Onboarding/CS: shorten time-to-value and improve early retention metrics; reduce first meaningful reply time to X hours
- People: run People Analyzer and confirm right-people/right-seats for leadership

Each leader holds 1–3 personal Rocks aligned to the company Rocks.

### Core processes to document (20% detail for 80% coverage)
- Sales, Customer Success/Delivery, Product, Engineering, Admin
Define owners, the 5–9 high-level steps, and the single source of truth. Mark “followed by all”.

### Tooling
- Use Google Sheet for all EOS tools and templates: V/TO, Scorecard, Rocks, Issues, To-Dos, Accountability Chart, and People Analyzer.

### Rollout timeline (2025-09-01 → 2025-12-31)
Sept (Install and kick off)
- Leadership kickoff (half day): teach EOS, agree on roles, draft `Accountability Chart`, set meeting pulse
- Vision: Draft `V/TO` (Vision Building Day 1/2 across two sessions)
- Cadence: Start weekly Leadership L10 the week of 9/1
- Scorecard: Implement 12 Scorecard metrics with owners and thresholds; begin tracking by week 3
- Rocks: Set Q4 company Rocks and 1–3 Rocks per leader; create Rock tracker

Oct (Stabilize basics)
- Run L10 every week; enforce start/stop, on-time, on-agenda
- Finalize `V/TO`; communicate to leadership and key managers
- Pilot departmental L10s for Sales and Engineering (biweekly to start if needed)
- People: Run People Analyzer on leadership; seat-checks and gap list

Nov (Process and scale)
- Document 6–8 core processes at 20% detail; assign owners; adopt “followed by all”
- Strengthen Scorecard (tighten thresholds, retire vanity metrics)
- Quarterly prep: pre-work for Q1 Rocks and issues list

Dec (Close and plan)
- EOS-style Quarterly session: review Q4 Rocks, set Q1 2026 Rocks, refresh issues list
- Confirm departmental L10 rollouts and owners; schedule the annual 2‑day in early Jan
- Retrospective on self-implementation: what to tighten in cadence, metrics, or roles

### Presentation plan to leadership (first session outline)
- Context: why EOS, why now; expected benefits for a small team
- How EOS works: 6 key components, tools we’ll use, what changes for us
- Roles: Visionary/Integrator split, decision rights, how we escalate/IDS
- Cadence: L10 weekly, Quarterly sessions, Rocks, Scorecard
- What we need from each leader: ownership of numbers and Rocks; meeting hygiene

### Risks and guardrails
- Risk: over-customization → Guardrail: default to standard EOS templates
- Risk: meetings drift → Guardrail: timebox, follow L10, track to-dos and reassign owners fast
- Risk: metric sprawl → Guardrail: cap Scorecard at 12 metrics; review quarterly
- Risk: unclear decision rights → Guardrail: use Accountability Chart and Integrator tie‑breaks

### Definition of “installed” by EOY 2025
- Weekly Leadership L10 running to spec for 8+ consecutive weeks
- Finalized `V/TO` and leadership `Accountability Chart`
- Scorecard with 12 metrics, owners, thresholds, and weekly trend data consistently collected
- Q4 Rocks completed/graded; Q1 2026 Rocks set in Dec Quarterly
- At least Sales and Engineering running consistent L10s (even if biweekly to start)

### Light checklist (working)
- Draft and iterate `V/TO`
- Build `Accountability Chart` (leadership, then first-layer teams)
- Launch leadership L10; establish Google Sheet for Scorecard, Rocks, Issues, and To-Dos
- Stand up 12-metric Scorecard with owners and thresholds; establish data collection process; remove/replace low-signal metrics
- Set and track Rocks; weekly check-ins; mid-quarter course-correct
- Run People Analyzer; address right-people/right-seats gaps
- Document core processes; confirm “followed by all”
- Conduct Dec Quarterly; schedule Jan annual (2 days)

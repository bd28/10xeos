# EOS Implementation Kickoff Meeting
## 4-Hour Session Outline
**Date:** September 2025  
**Duration:** 4 hours  
**Goal:** Complete EOS foundation and be ready to start L10s the following week

> **ðŸš€ ACCELERATED IMPLEMENTATION NOTE**  
> **Typical EOS implementations take 6-12 months with multiple sessions and external consultants. We're condensing this into a single 4-hour session and immediate execution.**  
>   
> **What this means for the team:**
> - **We're moving 10x faster** than standard EOS rollouts
> - **You may need to do some homework** outside this meeting to fully digest concepts
> - **We'll learn together as we go** - no one needs to be an EOS expert
> - **This is a team effort** - we're all in this together, building and refining as we execute
> - **Collaboration and feedback** are essential as we iterate and improve
>   
> **Our approach: Build the foundation today, perfect it through weekly practice.**
